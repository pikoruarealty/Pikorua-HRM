# Pikorua HRM — API Specification

> Companion to PRD.md and SCHEMA.md. All endpoints are implemented as Next.js Route Handlers (`app/api/.../route.ts`) or Server Actions where appropriate. Auth is JWT/session-based; every endpoint below lists which roles may call it. `Admin` and `HR` are treated identically everywhere ("Finance roles") unless noted.

**Conventions:**
- Base path: `/api/v1`
- All responses: `{ data, error }` shape. Errors: `{ data: null, error: { code, message } }`
- Auth via session cookie (or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) — every route below requires authentication unless marked Public.
- Role shorthand: `Admin/HR` = finance roles, `Lead` = Team Lead roles, `Employee` = individual contributor roles, `Any` = any authenticated role.

## 1. Auth

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/auth/login` | Public | `{ email, password }` → session + user profile (id, role, employee_id). Rate-limited (5/15min per ip+email, 20/15min per ip → `429 RATE_LIMITED` + `Retry-After`); success/failure/blocked attempts are audited. |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | Any | |
| GET | `/auth/me` | Any | returns current user + role + employee profile summary |
| POST | `/auth/change-password` | Any (self) | `{ current_password, new_password }` — re-verifies the current password; policy: ≥10 chars, mixed case, a digit. Audited. Added 2026-07-15 (production hardening). |

---

## 2. Employees & Org Structure — **Track A**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/employees` | Admin/HR (all), Lead (own team only), Employee (self only) | Query filters: `department_id`, `team_id`. Response scoped server-side by role — do not rely on frontend filtering. |
| GET | `/employees/:id` | Admin/HR (any), Lead (if in own team), Employee (self only) | Responses include `photoUrl` (authenticated serving path) since 2026-07-15 |
| POST | `/employees` | Admin/HR | **multipart/form-data since 2026-07-15**: employee fields as form fields + a **required `photo` image file** (JPEG/PNG/WebP ≤ 5MB). JSON bodies are rejected with 422. |
| PATCH | `/employees/:id` | Admin/HR | Editable: salary, department, team, status, device_uid mapping |
| DELETE | `/employees/:id` | Admin | Soft-delete (status → inactive) |
| GET | `/employees/:id/photo` | Any | Serves the profile photo bytes (photos appear in lists/calendar for every role — not golden-rule data). 404 if none. |
| POST | `/employees/:id/photo` | Admin/HR | multipart `photo` file — upload/replace (also backfills pre-requirement employees). Audited. |
| GET | `/departments` | Any | Returns departments + their `department_labels` config |
| POST | `/departments` | Admin | `{ name, type_key }` |
| GET | `/departments/:type_key/labels` | Any | Returns work_unit/sub_unit/work_item label mapping for that department type |
| PUT | `/departments/:type_key/labels` | Admin | Update label config — this is how a new department's terminology is configured |
| GET | `/teams` | Admin/HR (all), Lead/Employee (own department) | |
| POST | `/teams` | Admin/HR | `{ department_id, name, team_lead_id }` |
| PATCH | `/teams/:id` | Admin/HR | reassign lead, rename |

## 3. Attendance — **Track A**

> **v1 = manual clock-in/clock-out + HR/Admin approval.** The biometric device LAN-sync worker and its internal endpoint are **deferred, not built in v1** — see PRD §5.1.1 and Implementation Plan for the future-phase design (kept for context continuity only).

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/attendance/clock-in` | Employee | Server-timestamped; creates/updates today's `attendance_records` row for the current employee with `clock_in_raw` |
| POST | `/attendance/clock-out` | Employee | Server-timestamped; sets `clock_out_raw` on today's row |
| GET | `/attendance` | Admin/HR (all), Lead (own team), Employee (self) | filters: `employee_id`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `approval_status` |
| GET | `/attendance/:employee_id/summary` | Admin/HR, Lead (own team), Employee (self) | monthly summary: total late count, half-days, unpaid leave days — computed from **approved** records only, feeds payroll |
| PATCH | `/attendance/:id/edit` | Admin/HR | Edits `clock_in_approved`/`clock_out_approved` (e.g., correcting a forgotten clock-out) |
| PATCH | `/attendance/:id/approve` | Admin/HR | Sets `approval_status = approved`, `approved_by`, `approved_at`. If not separately edited first, approved times default to the raw values. |
| GET | `/attendance/overview` | Admin/HR | Added 2026-07-15. One-day glance: `?date=YYYY-MM-DD` (default today) → `{ date, holiday, counts: { total, present, halfDay, onLeave, absent, late, pendingApproval }, rows: [per-employee status] }`. A holiday date suppresses "absent". |
| POST | `/attendance/manual` | **Admin only** | Added 2026-07-15 (manual override). `{ employee_id, date, clock_in, clock_out?, reason }` — creates/overwrites the record's **approved** times, written pre-approved with the admin as approver; raw clock values never touched. Audited (`attendance.manual_create` / `attendance.manual_override`). |

| GET | `/work-units` | Admin/HR (all), Lead (own department), Employee (assigned or own department, status-only view) | filters: `department_id` |
| POST | `/work-units` | Lead, Admin/HR | Creates a Project/Campaign; `team_lead_id` defaults to creator if Lead |
| GET | `/work-units/:id` | Any (scoped) | nested response includes sub_units + work_items |
| PATCH | `/work-units/:id` | Lead (own), Admin/HR | status changes, rename |
| POST | `/work-units/:id/sub-units` | Lead (own work_unit), Admin/HR | `{ name }` |
| POST | `/sub-units/:id/work-items` | Lead (own), Admin/HR | `{ title, assigned_to, mode, task_points? , target_value? }` — Lead sets task_points for atomic mode |
| PATCH | `/work-items/:id` | Assigned Employee (status/current_value only), Lead (all fields) | Employees update their own task's status (atomic) or current_value (metric); Leads can reassign/edit points |
| GET | `/work-items/mine` | Employee | tasks assigned to the current employee, across work units |

## 5. Daily Planning / EOD — **Track B**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| GET | `/payslips/:id` | Admin/HR (any), Employee (self only) | |
| PATCH | `/payslips/:id/finalize` | Admin/HR | draft → finalized |
| PATCH | `/payslips/:id/unfinalize` | **Admin only** | Added 2026-07-15 (manual override). finalized → draft; `{ reason }` required, audited. |
| DELETE | `/payslips/:id` | **Admin only** | Added 2026-07-15 (manual override). Drafts only (409 otherwise) — the unfinalize → delete → regenerate correction flow. Audited. |

## 9. Assets (stub) — **Track B (low priority)**

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/assets` | Admin/HR | placeholder, not built out in v1 |

---

## 9b. Operations & Audit (production hardening, added 2026-07-15)

| Method | Path | Roles | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Public | **Not under `/api/v1`.** Liveness/readiness probe: `{ status, db }`, `503` if the DB is down. No auth, no version info. |
| GET | `/audit-logs` | **Admin only** (narrower than Admin/HR — HR's own actions are part of the trail) | Append-only audit trail. Filters: `action` (prefix match), `actor_user_id`, `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `date_from`, `date_to`; paginated (`page`, `limit` ≤ 200). Rows are written by `audit()` from `@/lib/audit` — see CLAUDE.md conventions for which mutations must audit. |

## 10. Cross-cutting: Scheduled Jobs (not user-facing endpoints, but must exist)

These run via a lightweight cron mechanism (see Implementation Plan §6 — no LAN-dependent worker needed in v1):

- **On clock-in/out**: compute `total_hours`/`is_half_day` for the day's `attendance_records` row once both times exist (does not require approval first, but payroll only counts `approved` rows).
- **Nightly**: check `date_of_birth`/`date_of_joining` against today's date → populate `events/today` cache + push birthday/anniversary notifications.
- **Recurring, per-meeting**: at `scheduled_at − reminder_lead_minutes`, push a reminder notification to all invitees (individual + expanded team invitees) of each upcoming meeting.
- **Weekly/Monthly**: compute `recognition_snapshots` from point ledger (Tech) / metric task performance (Sales/BD, scoped per department per the monthly target reset), and flag `is_employee_of_month` for each department's monthly top performer.
- **Monthly** (triggered manually by HR via `/payslips/generate`, not fully automatic in v1 per PRD): aggregate late/leave/half-day counts (from approved attendance only) for deduction calculation, and look up `is_employee_of_month` for reference display.
