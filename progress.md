## Phase 0 — Shared Foundation (`main`)

Built together before the two tracks branch off. Both tracks depend on these files.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Repo scaffold (npm workspaces, `apps/web`, root `prisma/`) | ✅ | Matches IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN §2 tree |
| Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn tokens | ✅ | `apps/web` (Next 14 App Router) |
| `.env.example` (all shared env vars) | ✅ | DB, AUTH_SECRET, S3, CRON_SECRET |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` — **full** schema, all tables | ✅ | Every table from SCHEMA.md; deferred `device_punch_raw` intentionally omitted |
| `lib/db` — Prisma client singleton | ✅ | `@/lib/db/prisma` |
| `lib/rbac` — roles + `requireRole()` + role groups | ✅ | 7 roles; `bde_lead` deliberately excluded (⚠️ see open questions) |
| `lib/auth` — password hashing + JWT session | ✅ | bcryptjs + jose; `getSession()` |
| `lib/api` — `{ data, error }` envelope | ✅ | `ok()` / `fail()` / `failFor()` |
| Auth routes: login / logout / me | ✅ | `app/api/v1/auth/*` |
| `components/ui` — shadcn primitives | ✅ | button, card, input, label, badge, table |
| Cross-track helper contracts (signatures) | ✅ | `getApprovedReimbursementTotal`, `getEmployeeOfMonthStatus` — stubbed, throw NotImplemented (Track B implements) |
| Seed script (payroll config, 3 depts + labels, teams, 7 role users) | ✅ | `prisma/seed.ts`, default pw `Password123!` |
| Dependency-graph tooling ("graphify") | ✅ | dependency-cruiser: `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` + `depgraph:*` npm scripts; enforces no-circular + track boundaries. SVG output needs GraphViz `dot`. |
| `bun install` + dev server running | ✅ | Confirmed by user 2026-07-13: `bun install` succeeded, `bun run dev` starts (a stale `.next/cache/webpack` pack file warning appeared — benign, cache-only, Next rebuilds it). |
| First Prisma migration + `bun run build` verified | ⬜ | Not yet confirmed — still need `bun run prisma:migrate` (requires a reachable Postgres `DATABASE_URL`) and a full `bun run build`. |

### Package manager / runtime: **Bun** (1.3.14)
Bun is the package manager and runtime for this project. Bun runs the TypeScript seed directly (`bun prisma/seed.ts`), so `tsx` was dropped. Root scripts use `bun run --filter=@pikorua-hrm/web <script>` for the workspace app.

### To finish Phase 0 (next actions)
1. ~~`bun install`~~ ✅ done.
2. Set up a Postgres DB, copy `.env.example` → `.env`, set `DATABASE_URL` + `AUTH_SECRET`.
3. `bun run prisma:migrate` (creates the initial migration from the full schema).
4. `bun run db:seed`.
5. Confirm login works end-to-end (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`).
6. `bun run build` to confirm the scaffold compiles.
7. Then branch: `track-a/*` and `track-b/*`.

## Open decisions (blocking specific features — confirm with stakeholder)
See PRD §7. Tracked in memory (`open-questions`):
1. ⚠️ `bde_lead` role — needed or not? (currently excluded from role enum)
2. ⚠️ Meeting reminder channel — in-app only vs. also email/SMS (assuming in-app)
3. ⚠️ Employee of the Month ties — single winner vs. multiple
4. ⚠️ Monthly metric-target reset — new row per month vs. reset-in-place (Track B to decide)
